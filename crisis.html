    <h2> What is the definition of unemployed?</h2>
    <p>Unemployment is a term referring to individuals who are employable and actively seeking a job but are<br>unable to find a job. Included in this group are those people in the workforce who are working but do not<br> have an appropriate job. Usually measured by the unemployment rate, which is dividing the number of<br> unemployed people by the total number of people in the workforce, unemployment serves as one of the<br> indicators of a country’s economic status.</p>

    <h2>Causes of unemployment</h2>
    <p>Unemployment is caused by various reasons that come from both the demand side, or employer, and the<br> supply side, or the worker.</p>

    <p>Demand-side reductions may be caused by high interest rates, global recession, and financial crisis.<br> From the supply side, frictional unemployment and structural employment play a great role.</p>

    <h2>Effects</h2>

    <p>Unemployment causes workers to suffer financial hardship that impacts families, relationships, and<br> communities. When it happens, consumer spending, which is one of an economy’s key drivers of growth,<br> goes down, leading to a recession or even a depression when left unaddressed.</p>

<h1>Why does it matter to You?</h1>
<p>As unemployment rate increase, unemployed workers lose their purchasing power,<br> which can lead to unemployment for other workers, creating a cascading effect that<br> ripples through the economy. In this way, unemployment even impacts those who are<br> still employed.</p>
